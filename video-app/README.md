# VideoApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.

I have zipped both frontend and backend. Front end is in video-app folder and backend is in video-server folder

Take the following steps to run the video app

## Backend

- Go to the folder `video-server`
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm start`
- Check the backend server is running by going to `http://localhost/3000/videos`, which will return videos data in JSON format

## Frontend

- Go to the folder `video-app`
- Run `npm i`
- Run `ng server`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/videos` to get the list of the videos

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
